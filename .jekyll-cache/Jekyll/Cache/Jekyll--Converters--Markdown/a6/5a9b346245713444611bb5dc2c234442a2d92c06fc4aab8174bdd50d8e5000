I"º<p>A couple of weeks ago, before deciding to do an actual blog, I made my very first commit to github. It was for my first app (if a few hundred lines of code can be called such), a calculator for pool operators. Itâ€™s not what youâ€™d call professional grade - itâ€™s janky in places, super simple, has essentially no error handling, and is not yet fully featured. But itâ€™s mine, it didnâ€™t come from a tutorial, and itâ€™s a start.</p>
