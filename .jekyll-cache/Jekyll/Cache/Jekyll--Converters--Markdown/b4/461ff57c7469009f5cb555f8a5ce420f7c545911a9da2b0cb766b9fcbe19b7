I"¿<p><strong>Who is Josh Byrd?</strong></p>

<p>Iâ€™m a middle-aged father and husband who, after a consistent but lackluster career decided to change just frigginâ€™ <em>everything</em> and fulfill my dream of working in tech. I went back to school, am working my way toward a masterâ€™s degree and hope to land somewhere in data science or software development.</p>

<p>In latin, altera vita means â€˜second lifeâ€™, and it seemed fitting for this, my hopefully successful, second go-round.</p>

<p><strong>Who is this page for?</strong></p>

<p>Originally I had planned to just have a Github page to act as an online portfolio. I decided to add a blog because I thought that there are probably several people out there trying make a midlife (or any other time) career change that might benefit from my experiences. Iâ€™m not a motivational speaker, nor am I trying to sell anything to anyone. Iâ€™ve not achieved wealth and fame by following six special steps and I canâ€™t tell you what you should be doing. Iâ€™m still very much in the process, putting in the work, and hoping it will pay off. But maybe I can show others out there working hard to achieve a goal that they arenâ€™t alone in their endeavors.</p>
