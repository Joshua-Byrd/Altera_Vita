I've not kept up with this. 

When I decided to start a blog, I had two objectives in mind. First, I wanted an accompaniment to my portfolio, so that, rather than having a Github with a series of disparate projects, there was some context surrounding it. After all, anybody can copy and paste code from Stack Overflow or Dataquest and call it their own. I wanted people to see my progession, what I've done, and, hopefully, how far I've come. 

Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, I wanted to show the unique challenges of being an adult learner. Because it's *not* the same as being twenty years old and going to school for the first time. There are real difficulties inherent to trying to change your life that I feel get glossed over too often by the rah-rah motivational crowd.  

The reality, however, is that the vast majority of those difficulties fall under the same umbrella: time.  

There just isn't enough of it, ever. 

In the last few weeks, I finished up my summer course at WVU, finished the introductory stats section of Dataquest, and applied to two master's programs. I've also uploaded a few more projects to my [Github](http://github.com/Joshua-Byrd). It's all just so damn time consuming. As much as I would love to devote more time to the blog (and I would; writing is my first love), the time just isn't there to devote.  

## Grad School

I applied to one computer science program and one data science program. Both are long shots due to my lack of higher math, but I have to try. I'm hoping my GPA, projects, and letters of recommendation will give me a boost, but we'll see.

I've been working my way through Khan Academy's courses to make up for the math I haven't had, but that's tough too, due to the aforementioned time issue.  I've had a fair amount of discrete math (set theory, probability, and combinatorics), but I've never had calculus. So I picked up a copy of *Calculus: A Rigorous First Course* from Daniel Velleman and *Mathematics: A Discrete Introduction* by Edward Scheinerman (mostly for the proofs stuff), to start working through those as well. Tolstoy said the two most powerful warriors are patience and time, but I'm running out of both.
