A couple of weeks ago, before deciding to do an actual blog, I made my very first commit to github. It was for my first app (if a few hundred lines of code can be called such), a [calculator for pool operators](https://github.com/Joshua-Byrd/PMP). It's not what you'd call professional grade - it's janky, super simple, has essentially no error handling, and is not yet fully featured. But it's mine, and it didn't come from a tutorial. I was a pool operator for an aquatic park for several years, and after running all the tests each morning, I would have to figure out how much of each chemical to add to create the necessary change in chemistry. Not super complicated, but a pit of a pain when you have multiple bodies of water to deal with. It seemed like there must be an easier way, so PMP was born. Eventually, I'd like to make it into a mobile app that will also export the daily readings to a specific folder or database.    

It's a weird feeling to put something you've created out into the aether for anyone to see. I realize that most of the users on Github are actual professionals, with real projects that people actually want to look at and use, and this is, well, not those things, so it sort of feels like putting a lumpy made-in-shop-class ashtray next to Rodin's sculptures. That's somewhat hyperbolic, but you get the point.  

It took a few deep breaths and some cringing to hit the enter key, but I did it. It's there, it's a first step, and I just have to remind myself that we all have to take those.
