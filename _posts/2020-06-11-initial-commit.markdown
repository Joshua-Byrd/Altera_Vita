A couple of weeks ago, before deciding to do an actual blog, I made my very first commit to github. It was for my first app (if a few hundred lines of code can be called such), a calculator for pool operators. It's not what you'd call professional grade - it's janky in places, super simple, has essentially no error handling, and is not yet fully featured. But it's mine, it didn't come from a tutorial, and it's a start.  

It's a weird feeling to put something you've created out into the aether for anyone to see. I realize that most of the users on Github are actual professionals, with real projects that people actually want to look at and use, and this is, well, not those things, so it sort of feels like putting a lumpy made-in-shop-class ashtray next to Rodin's sculptures.

Ok. So, that's hyperbolic, but you get the point.  

It took a few deep breaths and some cringing to hit the enter key, but I did it. It's there, it's a first step, and I just have to remind myself that we all have to take those.
