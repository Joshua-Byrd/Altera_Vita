Here's the first truth about going back to school: you will *always* be tired.  

Until a few months ago, this was my typical daily schedule:

3:00am - Wake up, read the news, and start working on school work.   
6:00am - Take a shower, get ready for work.  
6:30am - Wake my daughter up, make her breakfast, get her ready for school.  
8:00am - Drop her off at school, get to work by 8:30.  
8:30am-5:00pm - Work.  
5:30pm - Pick my daughter up from the after-school program.  
6:00pm - Dinner, family time, reading before bed etc.  
9:00pm - Bedtime *usually*.  

Yes, I literally woke up at 3:00am almost every day for three years. I did this for two reasons. First, it was the only guaranteed quiet time in my household. I am not good at studying with noise or even music unless is something quiet and ambient. And, second, the way I saw it, if I worked in the morning before everyone woke up, I wasn't taking time away from my family for this crazy pursuit. I feel extremely guilty about that sometimes.

A year and a half ago, this changed when we added a new baby. My wife generally handled getting him to and from the in-laws, who thankfully watched him during the day, and my schedule didn't change drastically. There was of course, the first six months or so when we alternated waking up for feedings. That time is pretty hazy.  

In March, everything changed again when Covid-19 came to America. I lost my job and took over schooling and childcare when the schools shut down and the governor issued stay-at-home orders.
A few months on and I'm still home with the kids, and, frankly, somewhat gratefully, as cases begin to surge again. But it is extremely stressful.

In some ways, it's more difficult to be the housespouse than to work outside the home. When you have a normal job, areas of your life are more easily delineated. I did my work in the morning, then got my daughter ready, then went to work, then came home and did the evening stuff.  Everything was compartmentalized. Not so when you're home all the time.  As I write this, the youngest is screaming in his crib fighting a nap while my daughter plays Minecraft servers with her friend, arguing over who stole whose iron ore.  But these are the moments I have to work, so I do.

I still wake up around 4:30, but I started a summer course at he beginning of this month and the mornings are generally reserved for working on that. Summer courses are compressed, which means you have about six weeks to do a normally fourteen week course. It's kind of ridiculous, but I digress.

So that's what going back to school is like as a working (mostly) adult. It's committing to doing it no matter what challenges (like global pandemics) life throws at you, and it's accepting that things are going to be crazy and hectic and you're just going to be tired a lot of time. And it's doing it all on a hope and a prayer that it pays off in the end, because the hard truth is you really don't know. There are always plenty of unemployed college graduates, and that's more true than ever.
