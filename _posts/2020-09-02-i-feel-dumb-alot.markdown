As the summer semester came to an end, and the fall semester (my last!) approached, I was needing a break from the data analytics grind, so I decided to try freeCodeCamp's web development curriculum. Web design was my true first exposure to the amazing power of coding (if you can call straight HTML coding), and I created my first site on Angelfire at fifteen. Younger readers won't know what Angelfire is, and that's okay, but it was an atrocious platform in the '90s, which, along with Geocities, was responsible for a whole lot of people with zero talent (like myself) being able to share their innermost thoughts with the world. For me, it allowed to create a website where I shared bass tablature and lessons. The hubris of my fifteen-year-old self thinking I was good enough teach other people. 

Actually, I was a pretty damn good bass player and I *did* have something to share, but that's beside the point. I never doubted that there was someone out there who would enjoy and benefit from the content I made. I think as an adult, whenever we try something new, we're constantly worried about how we'll be perceived by others. We act like it's so embarassing just to try and do something, as if there was a shadoowy figure waiting in the proverbial wings to to scream, HaHa, you're *stupid*!" as soon as make a mistake. 

Maybe it's just me. 

Keep trying new things is the point I'm trying to make. So what if you fail? You will die, and likely sooner than you wish, and not one person will care what things you tried and failed at. But the people closest to you will probably remember you as someone who was no afraid to jump in with both feet and see what happens.  

The title of this post, if you're wondering, refers the many, many times I've questioned my ability to do computer science or analytics or anything more complicated than making coffee.
