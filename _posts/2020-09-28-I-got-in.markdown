I did it! I have been accepted into the Master's program that I applied for, and I start in January! I have
no idea what the protocol is in a situation like this, about announcing getting into a particular school, and the superstitious
part of me half doesn't believe it's real anyway, so I think for now I will keep the school/program under wraps. 
At least until I'm actually in the classes, and working on my degree. 

But still...I did it. 

All the work has paid off, and it feels like being given a second chance at fulfilling a dream. I'm so excited 
I can't sleep at night, and I can't wait to finish this semester and get started. I'm also more than a little intimidated
and nervous. I'd like to chalk it up to imposter syndrome, but I know that this will be more rigorous and challenging
than anything I've done thus far. But I am so ready for this challenge. I think. I hope. 

There have been precious few updates to either the blog and my Github in the last few weeks because I've been so busy, 
and because I've been working on Java lately. I know that that is a big part of my upcoming curriculum, so 
that's been my focus of late and I hope to have some new projects to upload soon. I also spent some time on 
HTML and CSS because I want to up upgrade this to a genuine porfolio page in the near future. I'm not under
the illusion my skills are job-ready at this point, but soon...

I did it. I still can't believe I did it.
