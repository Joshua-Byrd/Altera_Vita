&lt;p&gt;Until a few months ago, this was my typical daily schedule:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3:00am - Wake up, read the news, and start working on school work. &lt;br /&gt;
6:00am - Take a shower, get ready for work.&lt;br /&gt;
6:30am - Wake my daughter up, make her breakfast, get her ready for school.&lt;br /&gt;
8:00am - Drop her off at school, get to work by 8:30.&lt;br /&gt;
8:30am-5:00pm - Work.&lt;br /&gt;
5:30pm - Pick my daughter up from the after-school program.&lt;br /&gt;
6:00pm - Dinner, family time, reading before bed etc.&lt;br /&gt;
9:00pm - Bedtime &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I literally woke up at 3:00am almost every day for three years. I did this for two reasons. First, it was the only guaranteed quiet time in my household. I am not good at studying with noise or even music unless is something quiet and ambient. And, second, the way I saw it, if I worked in the morning before everyone woke up, I wasn’t taking time away from my family for this crazy pursuit. I feel extremely guilty about that sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year and a half ago, this changed when we added a new baby. My wife generally handled getting him to and from the in-laws, who thankfully watched him during the day, and my schedule didn’t change drastically. There was of course, the first six months or so when we alternated waking up for feedings. That time is pretty hazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March, everything changed again when Covid-19 came to America. I lost my job and took over schooling and childcare when the schools shut down and the governor issued stay-at-home orders.
A few months on and I’m still home with the kids, and, frankly, somewhat gratefully, as cases begin to surge again. But it is extremely stressful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, it’s more difficult to be the housespouse than to work outside the home. When you have a normal job, areas of your life are more easily delineated. I did my work in the morning, then got my daughter ready, then went to work, then came home and did the evening stuff.  Everything was compartmentalized. Not so when you’re home all the time.  As I write this, the youngest is screaming in his crib fighting a nap while my daughter plays Minecraft servers with her friend, arguing over who stole whose iron ore.  But these are the moments I have to work, so I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still wake up around 4:30, but I started a summer course at he beginning of this month and the mornings are generally reserved for working on that. Summer courses are compressed, which means you have about six weeks to do a normally fourteen week course. It’s kind of ridiculous, but I digress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s what going back to school is like as a working (mostly) adult. It’s committing to doing it no matter what challenges (like global pandemics) life throws at you, and it’s accepting that things are going to be crazy and hectic and you’re just going to be tired a lot of time. And it’s doing it all on a hope and a prayer that it pays off in the end, because the hard truth is you really don’t know. There are always plenty of unemployed college graduates, and that’s more true than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

It was for my first app (if a few hundred lines of code can be called such), a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Joshua-Byrd/PMP&quot;&gt;calculator for pool operators&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not what you’d call professional grade - it’s janky, super simple, has essentially no error handling, and is not yet fully featured. But it’s mine, and it didn’t come from a tutorial. I was a pool operator for an aquatic park for several years, and after running all the tests each morning, I would have to figure out how much of each chemical to add to create the necessary change in chemistry. Not super complicated, but a pit of a pain when you have multiple bodies of water to deal with. It seemed like there must be an easier way, so PMP was born. Eventually, I’d like to make it into a mobile app that will also export the daily readings to a specific folder or database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a weird feeling to put something you’ve created out into the aether for anyone to see. I realize that most of the users on Github are actual professionals, with real projects that people actually want to look at and use, and this is, well, not those things, so it sort of feels like putting a lumpy made-in-shop-class ashtray next to Rodin’s sculptures. That’s somewhat hyperbolic, but you get the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a few deep breaths and some cringing to hit the enter key, but I did it. It’s there, it’s a first step, and I just have to remind myself that we all have to take those.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">A couple of weeks ago, before deciding to do an actual blog, I made my very first commit to github.

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible, with enough grit and determination, to make a complete career change when you’re fast approaching middle age?  I don’t mean moving from sales to marketing or from management to owning a business. Those are differences of degree, of quantity rather than quality.  I mean, is it possible to &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; change careers? Is it possible to do something so different and so out of your bailiwick that you’re forced to start from the ground floor - no experience, little or no knowledge, no contacts, nothing? Just you and new adventure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, here we are, and all I can say is - we’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, everyone. My name is Josh. Nice to meet you in this unidirectional sense.  If you have a moment, I’d like to tell you my story. It is, I imagine, the most convoluted route one has ever taken into the world of computer science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly four years ago, at the age of 35, I decided to go back to school. For the twelve years prior to that, I’d been in maintenance and construction in various capacities - honorable and necessary professions both, but not at all fulfilling or challenging.  I landed on that path by taking what I thought was going to be a summer job at a county park and ended up staying there almost seven years. You do a thing for seven years and suddenly it becomes difficult to do something different. People think you are that thing and can’t imagine you as anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was working in a nursing home when I decided to go back to school. I was in the maintenance department, of course, but I had impressed the executive director enough that he had recommended me for the administrator-in-training program. The program required a four-year degree, however, and although I had a few semesters of college from more years ago than I care to remember (surprise, surprise; I was a CS major), I had never finished. So back to school I went, because it seemed like a good idea at the time, as a multidisciplinary studies major because I could choose business and social work classes that I felt would be applicable to being an administrator.  I also thought I could finish relatively quickly. In that assumption, I was, unfortunately, completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years into my degree, I moved into the business office of the nursing home as the bookkeeper and realized what a ghastly mistake I had made. I can only imagine that health care is a wonderful field on the actual care side of it. The administrative side is, well, less so. Despite my title, most of my time was spent trying get new admissions approved for Medicaid because, shockingly, most people cannot afford to pay $387.50 per day. Another large chunk of my time went to making collections calls, sometimes to people who had had a loved one pass away in our facility. It was heartbreaking and grueling and just not for me. I know it’s a necessary profession, and I respect those that can do it, but I didn’t last long there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I found myself three quarters of the way through a degree that was geared towards a career I didn’t want. I thought I about quitting, but I knew that if I did, I’d be a maintenance person for the rest of my life. So I’ve continued on and will graduate in the fall. Several months ago, bored and tired of school, I decided to take a Python class on Udemy, just something fun to take my mind off of classes I didn’t want to be a part of anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, I remembered what it felt like to be challenged again - in a good way. In my first attempt at college, my intro to CS class was with Java and I’d had another class with C++. I liked both of them, but Python felt more intuitive. I grasped it quicker and it felt so good to &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; things again. There was a small section of the course devoted to data science that went into the numpy and pandas libraries (and machine learning, which I have not tackled yet), and that made sense to me as well. Being fairly proficient in Excel and Access, I grokked tabular data. Manipulating data-frames came (is coming would be more accurate) naturally to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than anything, I was just enjoying myself again. I am, above all things, a nerd at heart.  But I had forgotten that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s a person to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have less than a year left on my bachelor’s and for the last few months, along side my courses, I’ve been working my way through Dataquest’s data science program, learning more about Python, SQL, Linux and the command line, and Git. So, here I will build my portfolio, and in the next several months, I will start applying to master’s programs in computer science and (applied) data science. I know there are tech programs out there that are geared toward people without CS undergrad degrees, and that’s what I’ll look for.  I do have a high GPA, and hopefully with some projects under my belt and on display, I will have chance somewhere. I have the work ethic, if not the formal background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s kind of insane. I get it. This is not the way to go about things, and if the last four years have taught me anything, it’s that everything is easier when you do it in the prescribed order - high school, college, marriage, kids, etc. But, one other thing I’ve learned is that I’m more capable than I thought, and most things that feel impossible are actually just &lt;em&gt;really, really&lt;/em&gt; difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficult it is, then.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">We begin with a question.</summary></entry></feed>
