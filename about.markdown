**Who is Josh Byrd?**

I'm a middle-aged father and husband who, after a consistent but lackluster career decided to change just friggin' *everything* and fulfill my dream of working in tech. I went back to school, am working my way toward a master's degree and hope to land somewhere in data science or software development.

In latin, altera vita means 'second life', and it seemed fitting for this, my hopefully successful, second go-round.  

**Who is this page for?**

Originally I had planned to just have a Github page to act as an online portfolio. I decided to add a blog because I thought that there are probably several people out there trying make a midlife (or any other time) career change that might benefit from my experiences. I'm not a motivational speaker, nor am I trying to sell anything to anyone. I've not achieved wealth and fame by following six special steps and I can't tell you what you should be doing. I'm still very much in the process, putting in the work, and hoping it will pay off. But maybe I can show others out there working hard to achieve a goal that they aren't alone in their endeavors.
